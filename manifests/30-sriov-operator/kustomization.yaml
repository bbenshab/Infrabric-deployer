# NOTE: SriovNetworkNodePolicy and SriovNetwork are NOT included here
# Both SR-IOV policies and networks are auto-generated by roce-discovery (wave 2)
# based on actual hardware detected on each cluster. This ensures universal
# compatibility with any Mellanox NIC model, interface names, PCI locations,
# and avoids hardcoded namespaces or resource names.
